# Combat Numbers

Combat Numbers is a FoundryVTT module which showcases bouncing combat numbers on tokens, similar to old-school JRPGs. It currently has very basic functionality:

* Show the numeric damage amount on a token when it takes damage
* Show the numeric healing amount on a token when it gains HP

Currently, this module is only for the DnD5e game system as one cannot choose the associated "HP" attribute in this module.

## What Does This Look Like?

## Instructions

Install the module, enabled it for your world, and voila! Any token or actor which has an HP attribute that changes will have the relevant combat numbers applied to them.

## Future Planned Features

* Ability to specify the specific attribute for the combat numbers displayed
* Ability to change font, including size and colour
* Different animations instead of just a basic bounce
* ...please suggest some!
